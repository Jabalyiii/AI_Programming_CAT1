This is a class project testing how good we understand github and how to intergrate it with visual studio code.
The project entails python,Visual studio code and github 
i have to have a nice github profile and initialize a local git repository in visual Studio and push it to github
I also have to use python  language in all the question which is variables and data types,control structures,lists and loops, and functions
Then finally I have to do a mini python script thats called student_info_system.py
